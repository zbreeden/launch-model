# FourTwenty • The Launch

>>Launch templates meant to provide rigid structure, discipline, and constraint foundation needed for good quality data analysis.


The following provides an initial README.md seeding for every module birth.  Upon conception, this is step one when buildig the architecture of any decision model.

# <GLYPH> -> Project Name -> The ...

## Purpose
- Problem:
- Audience:
- Outcomes (measurable): <e.g., lead time ↓20%, on-time % ≥85%>

## Deliverables (MVP)
1) Delivery Readiness dashboard
2) Requirements→Release traceability
3) Risk & Decision log

## Data Contract (from seed.yaml)
- Entities: initiatives, deliveryFlow, traceability, risks
- IDs must be stable, strings.
- Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Percentages are decimals (0–1).

## UX Requirements
- Tabs: Delivery | Traceability | Risks
- Charts: Throughput (bar), Lead/Cycle (line)
- Tables: traceability columns = epic, story, ac[], tests[], dataImpact, compliance, owner, status, releaseId
- Accessibility: keyboard navigable, sensible aria labels.

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Live backend
- Auth
- Write APIs

## Definition of Done
- Renders from `seed.yaml` only (no hard-coded data)
- Type-checked props
- README updated with run steps
- Lint clean

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
